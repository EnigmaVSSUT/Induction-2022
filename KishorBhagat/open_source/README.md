# Git and GitHub

## What is git? 

Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source. 

 

Head over to https://git-scm.com/downloads to download and install git for your operating system. Make sure to select main as default branch name during the installation process. 

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.
