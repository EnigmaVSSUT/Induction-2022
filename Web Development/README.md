<hr>
Web development is the building and maintenance of websites, itâ€™s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website lookÂ great,Â workÂ fastÂ andÂ perform wellÂ with aÂ seamless user experience. It ranges from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. The field of web development can be divided intoÂ front-endÂ development (the user-facing side),Â back-endÂ development (the server side) andÂ full-stackÂ development.

2. Backend Development
3. Full Stack Development

### What is Frontend Development?
Front-end developmentÂ deals with theÂ layout,Â designÂ andÂ interactivityÂ usingÂ HTML, CSSÂ andÂ JavaScript_. The visual aspect of the website, the drop-down menus and the text, are all brought together by the front-end dev, who writes a series of programmes to bind and structure the elements, make them look good and add interactivity. It is known as client-side development.

### What is Backend Development?
The backendÂ of the web consists of theÂ serverÂ that hosts the website, an application for running it and a database to contain the data. Code written by back end developers is what communicates the database information to the browser. To do all this amazing stuff they use a variety of server-side languages, likeÂ PHP,Â Ruby,Â PythonÂ andÂ NodeJS.

### What is Full Stack Development?

Full stack web developmentÂ deals with the development of bothÂ clientÂ andÂ serverÂ software. Full-stack developers take care of both the front-end and the back-end, and need to know how the web works on all levels, in order to determine how the client- and server-sides will relate.
