<hr>
Web development is the building and maintenance of websites, it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.

### What is Frontend Development?
Front-end development deals with the layout, design and interactivity using HTML, CSS and JavaScript_. The visual aspect of the website, the drop-down menus and the text, are all brought together by the front-end dev, who writes a series of programmes to bind and structure the elements, make them look good and add interactivity. It is known as client-side development.

### What is Backend Development?
The backend of the web consists of the server that hosts the website, an application for running it and a database to contain the data. Code written by back end developers is what communicates the database information to the browser. To do all this amazing stuff they use a variety of server-side languages, like PHP, Ruby, Python and NodeJS.

### What is Full Stack Development?

Full stack web development deals with the development of both client and server software. Full-stack developers take care of both the front-end and the back-end, and need to know how the web works on all levels, in order to determine how the client- and server-sides will relate.
